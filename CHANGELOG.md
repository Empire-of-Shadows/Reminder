## [Unreleased] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- The dashboard now keeps a readable activity log. Every settings change, sign-in and rejected
  request is recorded with who did it, which server it was for, whether it worked and how long
  it took - so an admin can look back and see what happened. Ordinary page loads stay out of the
  log unless you ask for them (set `DASHBOARD_LOG_READS=1`).
- The dashboard had been running with debug logging left on, which buried anything useful under
  a constant stream of internal chatter. It now logs at the normal level, to both the console and
  a rotating file under `logs/`. Set `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` if you ever need the extra detail back.
